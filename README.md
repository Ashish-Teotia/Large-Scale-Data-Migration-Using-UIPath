# Large-Scale-Data-Migration-Using-UIPath
Data migration is the process of moving data from one location to another, one format to 
another, or one application to another. These days, data migrations are often started as firms 
move from on-premises infrastructure and applications to cloud-based storage and applications 
to optimize or transform their company. Our project helps in data migration in Customer 
Information recording application, where all the data of potential customers is stored in 
different formats in a single location, but the data itself is unordered. Our project extract data 
from this unordered data by applying different methods depending upon the type of file it is 
dealing with and stores it in a excel sheet. Now that data organisation is achieved meaning data 
from different file format is extract and is organised in a single file, the application loads the 
data onto a cloud portal with the of automation tool called UI Path.
